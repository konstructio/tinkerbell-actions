cexec (update docs)
```

The `cexec` action performs *execution* either within a [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) environment
or within the base filesystem. The primary use-case is being able to provision
files/an Operating System to disk and then being able to execute something that
perhaps resides within that filesystem.

```yaml
actions:
- name: "Install Grub"
  image: quay.io/tinkerbell/actions/cexec:latest
  timeout: 90
  environment:
      BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
      FS_TYPE: ext4
      CHROOT: y
      CMD_LINE: "grub-install --root-directory=/boot /dev/sda"
```

In order to execute multiple commands (seperated by a semi-colon) we will
need to leverage a shell. We do this by passing `sh -c` as a `DEFAULT_INTERPRETER`.
This interpreter will then parse your commands.

```yaml
actions:
- name: "Update packages"
  image: quay.io/tinkerbell/actions/cexec:latest
  timeout: 90
  environment:
      BLOCK_DEVICE: /dev/sda3
      FS_TYPE: ext4
      CHROOT: y
      DEFAULT_INTERPRETER: "/bin/sh -c"
      CMD_LINE: "apt-get -y update; apt-get -y upgrade"
```
